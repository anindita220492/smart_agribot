            "\n",
            "**Fungal Diseases:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Early Blight (Alternaria solani):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown spots with concentric rings (bullseye pattern) appear on lower leaves, gradually moving upwards.  Fruit can also develop similar spots, often near the stem end.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm, humid weather, often after periods of rain or overhead watering.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Good sanitation (remove infected leaves), crop rotation, proper spacing for air circulation, fungicide applications (copper-based, chlorothalonil, mancozeb).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit.  A white, fuzzy growth may appear on the undersides of leaves in humid conditions. Fruit turns brown, leathery, and decays rapidly.  Spreads very quickly.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Cool, wet weather (ideal: 60-70°F with high humidity).\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Very difficult to control once established. Prevention is key. Use resistant varieties, ensure good air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and apply preventative fungicides (chlorothalonil, copper-based). Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Small, circular spots on lower leaves, with a grayish-white center and a dark brown border. Spots often merge, causing leaves to yellow, brown, and drop.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm, humid weather, especially after rainfall.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Remove and destroy infected leaves, improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, mulch around plants to prevent soil splash, and apply fungicides (copper-based, chlorothalonil).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:**  Yellowing of lower leaves, often starting on one side of the plant.  Wilting occurs even when the soil is moist.  A brown discoloration of the vascular tissue (inside the stem) is characteristic.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm soil temperatures.  The fungus lives in the soil.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Use resistant varieties (look for \"F\" on the plant tag), practice crop rotation, solarize the soil, and improve soil drainage.  There is no cure for infected plants.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Verticillium Wilt (Verticillium dahliae):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Similar to Fusarium wilt – yellowing of lower leaves, wilting.  However, the vascular discoloration may be less pronounced.  V-shaped lesions may develop on leaves.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Cooler soil temperatures than Fusarium wilt. The fungus lives in the soil.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Use resistant varieties (look for \"V\" on the plant tag), practice crop rotation, solarize the soil, and improve soil drainage.  There is no cure for infected plants.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Anthracnose (Colletotrichum coccodes):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Sunken, circular spots on ripe fruit, often developing after harvest.  These spots may have concentric rings.  Can also affect leaves and stems, but less common.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm, humid weather.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Rotate crops, remove and destroy infected fruit and plant debris, mulch to prevent soil splash, and apply fungicides (copper-based, chlorothalonil).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Powdery Mildew:**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery growth on the surface of leaves and stems.  Can cause leaves to yellow and die.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Humid weather with moderate temperatures.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Improve air circulation, avoid overcrowding, use resistant varieties, and apply fungicides (sulfur-based, neem oil, potassium bicarbonate).\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Similar to bacterial speck, but the spots are generally larger and more irregular.  Spots on fruit may be raised and scab-like.  No yellow halo.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm, humid weather.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Use disease-free seed, avoid overhead watering, remove infected leaves, and apply copper-based bactericides. Resistant varieties exist.\n",

            "    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and browning of leaves, often starting on one side of the plant.  Brown streaks may develop on the stem.  Fruit may have small, raised spots with a white halo (bird's-eye spot).\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Warm, humid weather.  The bacteria can be seed-borne.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Use disease-free seed, remove and destroy infected plants, disinfect tools, and practice crop rotation.  Copper sprays may provide some protection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Viral Diseases:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) / Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Mottling (light and dark green patches) on leaves, stunted growth, distorted leaves (fern-like appearance), reduced fruit production.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Spread by handling infected plants, tools, or tobacco products.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Use resistant varieties, wash hands and tools thoroughly, avoid using tobacco products near tomato plants, and remove and destroy infected plants.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Ringspots, mottling, and yellowing on leaves. Stunted growth, bronzing of foliage. Fruit may have irregular shapes, blotches, or ringspots.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Transmitted by thrips.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Control thrips populations, remove weeds that may harbor the virus, use resistant varieties.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV):**\n",
            "    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of leaves, upward curling of leaves, stunted growth, reduced fruit set.\n",
            "    *   **Conditions:** Transmitted by whiteflies. More common in warmer climates.\n",
            "    *   **Control:**  Control whitefly populations, use resistant varieties.\n",

            "**General Preventative Measures (for all diseases):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Use disease-free seed and transplants:**  Buy from reputable sources.\n",
            "*   **Choose resistant varieties:**  Look for letters like \"V,\" \"F,\" \"N,\" \"T,\" and \"A\" on plant tags, indicating resistance to Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, nematodes, Tobacco Mosaic Virus, and Alternaria (early blight), respectively.\n",
            "*   **Proper spacing:**  Allow adequate air circulation between plants.\n",
            "*   **Good sanitation:**  Remove and destroy infected leaves and plant debris. Clean tools regularly.\n",
            "*   **Crop rotation:**  Avoid planting tomatoes (or other susceptible plants like peppers, eggplants, and potatoes) in the same location for at least 3 years.\n",
            "*   **Watering practices:**  Water at the base of the plants, avoiding overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Water early in the day so foliage can dry.\n",
            "*   **Mulching:**  Use mulch to prevent soil splash, which can spread disease spores.\n",
            "*   **Soil health:**  Ensure well-drained soil with adequate nutrients.\n",
            "*   **Monitor plants regularly:**  Early detection is key to successful disease management.\n",
            "*   **Proper fertilization:** Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which can promote lush growth that is more susceptible to disease.\n",
            "*   **Support your plants:** Staking or caging tomatoes helps with air circulation and keeps the plants off the ground.\n",

            "**Important Note:**  Disease identification can sometimes be tricky.  If you're unsure what disease your tomato plant has, consult your local agricultural extension office or a plant pathologist for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.  Using the wrong treatment can be ineffective or even harmful.\n",

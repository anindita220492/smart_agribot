            "*   **Proper Spacing:**  Allow adequate air circulation between plants to reduce humidity.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Water Properly:**  Water deeply and infrequently, avoiding overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Water at the base of the plant.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Good Soil Drainage:**  Ensure the soil drains well to prevent root rot.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Soil Health:**  Amend the soil with compost and other organic matter to improve drainage, nutrient content, and overall soil health.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Crop Rotation:**  Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year to prevent the buildup of soilborne pathogens.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Mulching:**  Apply mulch (straw, wood chips, or plastic) to suppress weeds, retain moisture, and prevent soil splash.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pruning:**  Prune suckers to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Sanitation:**  Remove and destroy infected plant material to prevent the spread of disease. Clean pruning tools regularly with a bleach solution.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Monitoring:**  Inspect plants regularly for signs of disease and pests.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Fungicides (Use Judiciously):**  If necessary, use appropriate fungicides preventatively or at the first sign of disease. Follow label instructions carefully. Copper-based fungicides, chlorothalonil, and mancozeb are common options.\n",
